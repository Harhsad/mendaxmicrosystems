            <h2 class="title-line">History of Mendax</h2>
            <p>Here's a little bit of history on our company. In the mid-late eighties Mendax was a well known, very popular, local BBS (bulletin board) called Mendax BBS which was running on Renegade software. In 1996 Mendax Microsystems was incorporated. In 1998, Intel Corporation was looking into creating a channel program called "Intel Premier Providers" (IPP). We were approached by one of their representative to join this program in June of 1999. That same year Intel introduced us to servers and by mid 2000, we introduced the first rack mount server which was called our Mendax Cayman server, based on the Intel 815 chipset.</p>
